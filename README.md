## **Project Title: Robust AI Data Foundation & NLP Pipeline for Legislative Tracking**

## **🚀 Overview**

This repository showcases a foundational project designed to establish the essential data infrastructure for advanced AI applications in the legal and legislative domain. If you're building an AI-powered system to track legislation, predict client interests, or perform in-depth analysis of legal documents, a clean, structured, and accessible data foundation is paramount.

This project delivers a fully functional and well-documented **data ingestion module** and a **foundational Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipeline**. It ensures that your historical client tracking data is securely integrated, and complex legislative text is expertly pre-processed, making it ready for advanced machine learning models. This solution provides the critical groundwork for accurate predictions and insightful analysis, laying the foundation for an effective AI-driven legislative intelligence system.

## **✨ Features**

This project provides a comprehensive, ready-to-integrate solution with the following key features:

### **1. Secure Historical Data Ingestion Module**

- **Custom-Built Ingestion Logic:** Developed a robust and secure module specifically designed to ingest your firm's historical client tracking data. This module handles a variety of common data formats (e.g., CSV, Excel spreadsheets, JSON, custom delimited files).
- **Data Integrity & Validation:** Implements rigorous validation checks during the ingestion process to ensure data quality and integrity, preventing errors and inconsistencies from polluting your dataset.
- **Secure Protocols:** Emphasizes secure data handling and transmission protocols to safeguard sensitive historical records as they are integrated into the system.

### **2. Foundational Natural Language Processing (NLP) Pipeline for Legislative Text**

- **Advanced Tokenization:** Breaks down raw legislative text into its fundamental linguistic units (words, phrases, punctuation), which is the crucial first step for any text analysis.
- **Basic Entity Recognition (NER):** Identifies and classifies key entities within legislative documents, such as dates, names of organizations (e.g., government bodies, corporations), geographical locations, and relevant legal terms or bill identifiers.
- **Intelligent Text Cleaning & Normalization:** Removes noise, irrelevant characters, boilerplate language, and inconsistencies from the text. This ensures only pertinent information is processed, ensuring standardized text for optimal downstream analysis and model performance.
- **Feature Preparation for AI Models:** Transforms the processed legislative text into numerical representations (e.g., basic word frequency vectors, term-document matrices) that can be directly utilized as input features for machine learning and predictive modeling tasks.

### **3. Optimized Core Database Schema (PostgreSQL)**

- **Robust Database Design:** Meticulous design and implementation of a foundational database schema using PostgreSQL, a reliable open-source relational database known for its robustness and extensibility.
- **Efficient Data Storage:** The schema is optimized for efficient storage of both raw and pre-processed client tracking data, as well as processed legislative information.
- **Query Performance:** Designed with indexing strategies to ensure data is logically organized, easily queryable, and optimized for high-performance analytical queries.

### **4. Comprehensive Technical Documentation**

- **Detailed Module Explanations:** Clear and thorough documentation of the data ingestion modules, outlining functionality, parameters, and usage.
- **Database Schema Blueprint:** A complete blueprint of the database schema, including table structures, relationships, and data types.
- **NLP Pipeline Overview:** An in-depth explanation of the NLP processes implemented, from tokenization to feature preparation.
- **Seamless Handoff:** Documentation ensures transparency, supports future development, and enables a smooth handover to internal teams or other developers.

## **🛠️ Technology Stack**

- **Python:** Core programming language for data processing and NLP.
  - pandas: For efficient data manipulation and transformation.
  - spaCy: For high-performance NLP tasks like tokenization, lemmatization, and basic entity recognition.
  - psycopg2: For PostgreSQL database connectivity.
- **PostgreSQL:** Relational database for structured data storage.

## **🚀 Installation & Setup**

To set up and run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YAgrawal-PRO/LegisPredict-AI.git
cd LegisPredict-AI
```

2. **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. **Install dependencies:**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm  # Download spaCy's small English model
```

4. **Set up PostgreSQL Database:**

- Ensure PostgreSQL is installed and running.
- Create a new database for the project (e.g., `legislation_db`).
- Update the database connection details in `config.py` (or an equivalent configuration file).

**Note:** Avoid hardcoding production credentials in `config.py`. Use environment variables or a secrets manager for better security.

5. **Prepare your data:**

- Place your historical client tracking data (e.g., `clients_tracking_history.csv`) in the `data/raw` directory.
- Place your raw legislative text files (e.g., `bill_text_1.txt`, `bill_text_2.txt`) in the `data/raw/legislation` directory.

## **💡 Usage**

Once the setup is complete, you can run the data ingestion and NLP pipelines:

1. **Run the database schema setup script:**

```bash
python scripts/setup_database.py
```

This script will create the necessary tables in your PostgreSQL database.

2. **Execute the data ingestion process:**

```bash
python scripts/ingest_client_data.py data/raw/clients_tracking_history.csv
```

This will load your client tracking data into the database.

3. **Process legislative text:**

```bash
python scripts/process_legislation.py data/raw/legislation/
```

This script reads legislative text files, applies the NLP pipeline, and stores the processed features in the database.

You can then query the PostgreSQL database directly to access the structured client tracking data and extracted NLP features.
